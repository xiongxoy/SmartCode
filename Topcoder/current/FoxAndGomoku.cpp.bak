// PROBLEM STATEMENT
// Fox Ciel is going to play Gomoku with her friend Fox Jiro.
Ciel plays better, so before they start she allowed Jiro to put some of his pieces on the board.


You are given a vector <string> board that represents a square board.
The character board[i][j] represents the cell with coordinates (i,j).
Each of those characters is either '.' (representing an empty cell) or 'o' (representing a cell with Jiro's piece).


Of course, Ciel does not want Jiro to win the game before she has a chance to play.
Thus she now has to check the board and determine whether there are five consecutive tokens somewhere on the board.


Determine whether there are 5 consecutive cells (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) that contain Jiro's tokens.
Return "found" (quotes for clarity) if there are five such cells anywhere on the board.
Otherwise, return "not found".
